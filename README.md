Fully Isolated USB DMX Adapter
==================


![USB DMX Isolated - Bare PCB](/Images/USB-DMX-ISOLATED_BarePCB.jpg)  

This USB DMX adapter is designed to be an functional foray into PCB design and assembly using primarily surface mount components.  The use of an isolating RS-485 transceiver differentiates this USB DMX adapter from others that can be purchased or built at a similar price point.
